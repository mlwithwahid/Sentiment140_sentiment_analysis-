Sentiment Analysis (Deep Learning)
This project applies deep learning techniques to classify text into positive or negative sentiment. It demonstrates the use of Neural Networks (TensorFlow/Keras) for Natural Language Processing (NLP).

📌 Project Overview
Built a deep learning sentiment classifier using TensorFlow/Keras.
Preprocessed text data with tokenization and padding.
Trained multiple architectures and compared their performance.
Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Saved trained models in both .h5 and .keras formats for deployment and reproducibility.

⚙️ Tech Stack
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
NLTK / Scikit-learn for preprocessing & evaluation
NumPy, Pandas for data handling

📊 Results
Achieved ~80% accuracy on the test set.
Balanced performance across both positive and negative classes.

Best model checkpoints saved as:
model.h5
best_model.keras
